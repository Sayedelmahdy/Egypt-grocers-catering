## Egyptian Catering Store Program

The Egyptian Catering Store Program is a user-friendly software designed specifically for catering stores in Egypt. It simplifies the process of managing customer orders, tracking sales, and maintaining transaction records. This program provides a streamlined interface for store workers to efficiently serve customers and handle their purchases.

### Features

1. **Customer Information:** The program allows the worker to enter the name of the cardholder, the number of people in their party, and the living difference amount. This information helps in customizing the order according to the customer's requirements.

2. **Product Selection:** The program presents a group of commodities to the worker, from which the customer can choose their desired items. The worker can add the selected products to the order, and the program will display a summary of the chosen commodities.

3. **Order Summary:** After adding the selected items, the program calculates the total sale amount and presents it to the worker. It also displays the amount owed by the customer, which must be paid, along with the remaining balance for the other commodities.
